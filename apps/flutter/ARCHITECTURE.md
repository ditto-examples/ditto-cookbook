# Flutter Apps - Architecture Documentation

> **Last Updated**: 2025-12-16

## Overview

This directory is a **placeholder** for future Flutter applications demonstrating Ditto SDK integration. No Flutter apps have been implemented yet.

## Purpose

This directory will contain Flutter applications showcasing:

- Offline-first architecture with Ditto SDK
- Real-time synchronization patterns for mobile platforms (iOS and Android)
- Mobile best practices for state management and testing
- Production-ready implementation examples

## Current Status

**Status**: Placeholder - No applications implemented

This directory currently contains only documentation:
- [README.md](README.md) - Comprehensive guide for Flutter app development with Ditto SDK
- This ARCHITECTURE.md file

## Future Applications

Flutter applications will be added to this directory as they are developed. Each application will:

1. Have its own subdirectory under `apps/flutter/`
2. Include comprehensive `ARCHITECTURE.md` documentation following the template at [docs/ARCHITECTURE_TEMPLATE.md](../../docs/ARCHITECTURE_TEMPLATE.md)
3. Demonstrate specific Ditto integration patterns
4. Include 80%+ test coverage
5. Follow Flutter/Dart best practices

## Documentation

For detailed information about Flutter app development in this cookbook, see:

- [Flutter Apps README](README.md) - Prerequisites, setup, and development guidelines
- [Architecture Template](../../docs/ARCHITECTURE_TEMPLATE.md) - Template for documenting Flutter apps
- [Development Guidelines](../../CLAUDE.md) - Project-wide development standards

## When Applications Are Added

When a new Flutter application is added to this directory:

1. Create a subdirectory: `apps/flutter/<app-name>/`
2. Create `ARCHITECTURE.md` in the app directory documenting its architecture
3. Update this file to list the new application
4. Update the "Apps in This Directory" section in [README.md](README.md)

**Note**: This file serves as a placeholder until actual Flutter applications are implemented. Once apps are added, this file should be updated to reflect the directory structure and list available applications.
