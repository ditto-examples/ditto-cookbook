# Architecture Summaries

This directory contains auto-generated architecture summaries for each app and tool in the Ditto Cookbook.

## Overview

The summaries are automatically generated by the architecture check script ([`../../.claude/scripts/documentation/architecture-check.sh`](../../.claude/scripts/documentation/architecture-check.sh)) based on the Overview section of each app's `ARCHITECTURE.md` file.

## Purpose

- **Quick Reference**: Provides a quick overview of each app without navigating to individual directories
- **Central Index**: Links to full architecture documentation for detailed information
- **Automated Sync**: Ensures summaries stay current with source documentation

## Structure

Each app/tool has its own summary file:

```
architecture/
├── README.md                    # This file
├── <app-name>-summary.md       # Auto-generated summary for each app
└── <tool-name>-summary.md      # Auto-generated summary for each tool
```

## Generation Process

Summaries are automatically generated when:

1. The architecture check script runs (triggered by task completion hook)
2. An app's `ARCHITECTURE.md` is created or updated
3. The central architecture index is updated

## Manual Regeneration

To manually regenerate all summaries:

```bash
# From repository root
./.claude/scripts/documentation/architecture-check.sh
```

## Note

**Do not manually edit files in this directory** - they are automatically generated and your changes will be overwritten. To update a summary, edit the Overview section of the corresponding app's `ARCHITECTURE.md` file.

## Current Status

No applications with ARCHITECTURE.md files have been found yet. This directory will be populated as applications are added to the repository.
